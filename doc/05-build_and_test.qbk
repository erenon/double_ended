[section Build and Test]

The library itself is header only, no separate build is required to use it, only
the `include/` directory has to be added to the compiler include search path.

[section Build the tests]

Although it is not required to use the library, the tests can be build separately.
A `Boost` tree is needed (version 1.59 or above), with at least `bjam` and `Boost.Serialization` library installed.
However, it's not required to use the `Boost` installation provided by the operating system or distribution.
To avoid conflicting with such installs, `BOOST_BUILD_PATH` can be explicitly specified:

    double_ended/test $ export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=/path/to/boost  # contains bjam tool, boost and stage libraries
    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam

The last command executed, the tests are compiled and executed. During compilation, no warning should be emitted
and each test should pass, indicated by the `**passed**` string on the output.
To change the used compiler, specify the toolchain switch:

    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam toolset=gcc # or clang or msvc

To build the tests in release mode, use the `release` variant:

    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam variant=release

On platforms where the [@https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki address sanitizer] is supported,
the `sanitize` variant can be used to look for memory related errors:

    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam variant=sanitize

A test coverage report can be generated when the GCC toolchain is in use:

    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam toolset=gcc variant=coverage
    double_ended/test $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam toolset=gcc lcov

[endsect]

[section Build the documentation]

To build the documentation (this one), run `bjam` in the `doc/` directory:

    double_ended/doc $ export BOOST_BUILD_PATH=/path/to/boost  # contains bjam tool
    double_ended/doc $ $BOOST_BUILD_PATH/bjam

The toolchain requires the quickbook, boostbook and doxygen tools to be
[@http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/reference/tools.html#idp88891216 properly configured].
